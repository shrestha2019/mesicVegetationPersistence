The script is used to calcualte mesic vegetation persistence (MVP). MVP classifies mesic vegetation (includes wetlands, riparian vegetation, wet meadows) 
 using time-series of Sentinel-2 and Landsat archives (1984-Current). It is used to map the vegetation dynamics  of the drylands. The approach measures moisture 
 dynamics using moisture change index (MCI). MCI uses VSDI to calcualte changes in moisture condition from the driest and wettest pixels in the time-series images.
 A detail analysis of method and result is found in the following paper. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969724006284. MVP is implemented 
 in Google Earth Engine and is available as an app. https://ns-boise.users.earthengine.app/view/mvp. 

 MVP app provides flexibility approach to measure and monitor mesic vegetaion throughout drylands, although is validated using data in the western United States.
